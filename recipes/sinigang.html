    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite dishes, Sinigang is a stewed dish that has a distinct sour taste due to the use of tamarind or other souring agents included in the dish.
        Usually served with rice.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, chopped</li>
        <li>2 plum tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
        <li>1 pound bone-in pork chops</li>
        <li>4 cups water, more if needed</li>
        <li>1 (1.41 ounce) package tamarind soup base (such as KnorrÂ®)</li>
        <li>1/2 pound fresh green beans, trimmed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.</li>
